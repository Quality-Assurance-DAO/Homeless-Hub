# Organisations approached

* [https://mustardtree.org.uk/activities/creativity](https://mustardtree.org.uk/activities/creativity) - Interested; but they have some staffing issues, and also might want a more sustained commitment than we can offer. But they are very sympathetic to the project. They have suggested not calling it "Homeless Hub" to participants, as they do not only engage homeless people, but others facing marginalisation, poverty, substance abuse, etc. They also work with Manchester Street Poem [https://mcrstreetpoem.com](https://mcrstreetpoem.com/)&#x20;
* [www.boothcentre.org.uk/arts.html](http://www.boothcentre.org.uk/arts.html) - Possibly interested. Emailed them.
* [www.backontrackmanchester.org.uk/cafe-project](http://www.backontrackmanchester.org.uk/cafe-project) - possibly. They have an education worker who may be looking for a new project.
* [https://emmaus.org.uk/south-manchester](https://emmaus.org.uk/south-manchester) - they are very new, but suggested I try\
  Mossley Emmaus (about 24 companions in their community)  \
  Salford Emmaus - Interested. Ist session on 10th Jan\
  Bolton - will call me back, but were quite wary&#x20;
* [https://www.salfordloavesandfishes.org.uk/](https://www.salfordloavesandfishes.org.uk/) - they are near Salford Emmaus - but difficult at present because still getting on track after Covid
* [https://thewellspring.co.uk](https://thewellspring.co.uk/) (Stockport). Interested, but their building is being renovated; possibly offsite? or digital engagement?

### Decision

After several meetings with different organisations, the best approach was to go with Salford Emmaus, who were enthusiastic about the project, and located near another project (Loaves and Fishes) who might also be interested later although they cannot take it on now.

# Approaching organisations

The first phase of the project is about finding organisations to work with.&#x20;

Before submitting the bid, I had talked in very general terms to a couple of organisations about the project; no definite commitments, but I'd got a general sense of what I was after. I knew this particular project ideally needed an established group, rather than a very changeable drop-in approach; and that it would work better with people who were not in immediate crisis.&#x20;

So in Nov and Dec 2021, I approached these groups:

* [https://mustardtree.org.uk/activities/creativity](https://mustardtree.org.uk/activities/creativity) - Interested; but they have some short-staffing issues, and also might want a more sustained commitment than we can offer. But they are very sympathetic to the project. They have suggested not calling it "Homeless Hub" to participants, as they do not only engage homeless people, but others facing marginalisation, poverty, substance abuse, etc. They also work with Manchester Street Poem [https://mcrstreetpoem.com](https://mcrstreetpoem.com/) and could put us in touch.
* [www.boothcentre.org.uk/arts.html](http://www.boothcentre.org.uk/arts.html) - Possibly interested. Emailed them; but never heard back. Like many of the big organisations, they're overstretched and understaffed. By coincidence, I met a staff member from here through a friend some weeks later - they'd got my email but had no time to reply.
* [www.backontrackmanchester.org.uk/cafe-project](http://www.backontrackmanchester.org.uk/cafe-project) - possibly. They have an education worker who might be the right person to ask. Emailed and phoned back, but again, never managed to talk to her.
* [https://emmaus.org.uk/south-manchester](https://emmaus.org.uk/south-manchester) - they are very new, so it's not for them; but suggested I try\
  Mossley Emmaus - possibly, but were unsure if they could fit it round existing activities  \
  Salford Emmaus - Interested. Ist session on 10th Jan\
  Bolton - will call me back, but were quite wary&#x20;
* [https://www.salfordloavesandfishes.org.uk/](https://www.salfordloavesandfishes.org.uk/) - they are near Salford Emmaus - they don't have capacity now, but maybe in future?
* [https://thewellspring.co.uk](https://thewellspring.co.uk/) (Stockport). Interested, but their building is being renovated; possibly offsite? or digital engagement?

### Other organisations tried but no capacity to do a project:

* [https://mhp.org.uk](https://mhp.org.uk/)
* [www.homeless.org.uk/homeless-england/service/justlife-centre-manchester](http://www.homeless.org.uk/homeless-england/service/justlife-centre-manchester)
* [www.boaztrust.org.uk](http://www.boaztrust.org.uk/)&#x20;
* [www.coffee4craig.org](http://www.coffee4craig.org/)
* [http://supportingpeopleinneed.org](http://supportingpeopleinneed.org/)
* [www.barnabus-manchester.org.uk/activities](http://www.barnabus-manchester.org.uk/activities)
* [www.lifeshare.org.uk/arts-service](http://www.lifeshare.org.uk/arts-service)
* www.justlife.org.uk/our-work/manchester

### Decision

After several meetings and chats with different organisations, the best approach is to go with Salford Emmaus, who are enthusiastic about the project, and located near another project (Loaves and Fishes) who might also be interested later although they cannot take it on now.

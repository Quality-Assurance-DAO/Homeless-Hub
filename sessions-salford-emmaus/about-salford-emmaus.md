# About Salford Emmaus

## Emmaus in the UK

[Emmaus](https://emmaus.org.uk/) is an international charitable organisation which runs 29 communities across the UK. Communities offer housing to between 20 and 40 people (called "Companions") who have been homeless. Companions get somewhere to live, support from staff, and 40 hours work a week in the community's charity shop.\

## Salford Emmaus

Homeless Hub is working with the Emmaus community in [Salford](https://emmaus.org.uk/salford/).

Salford Emmaus runs a 2nd-hand furniture shop, and a food bank/social supermarket. Staff think it's likely that 10 or 12 people would be interested in taking part in the project.

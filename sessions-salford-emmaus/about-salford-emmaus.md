# About Salford Emmaus

## Emmaus in the UK

[Emmaus](https://emmaus.org.uk) is an international charitable organisation which runs 29 communities across the UK. Communities offer housing to between 20 and 40 people (called "Companions") who have been homeless. Companions get somewhere to live, support from staff, and 40 hours work a week in the community's charity shop.\

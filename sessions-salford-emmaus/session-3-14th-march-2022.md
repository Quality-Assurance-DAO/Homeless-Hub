## **PEOPLE**

**8 people took part:** Chris, Joe, Jack, Barry, Kev, Julie, Darren and Vanessa

### SUM UP YOUR TAKE ON "MONEY" IN A SENTENCE?

### A TIME WHEN YOU FELT IN CONTROL FINANCIALLY?

### PROOF OF..?

We talked a bit more about the difference between proof-of-work and proof-of-stake.

One comment:\
_**"So proof of work - is that like when you go to sign on, and the Government wants you to prove that you haven't done any work since you last claimed?"**_\
\
The immediate answer is "No it's not that" - but on reflection... In our society, we notice, people who are unemployed are pretty excluded and vilified. Proving that you haven't done any work proves your right to benefits, sure; but getting state benefits in a way excludes you from society, in many people's eyes - it's like they see it as "society (which you are not fully a part of) gives something to you (who are outside society)". And proving that you _have_ done work might mean that you can't claim benefits, but it is pretty much like proving your right to be considered part of society at all, and (among other things) to take part in deciding what things are worth and what "society" considers valuable... (compare to how, in a POW blockchain, proving work gives you a right to be included in validating transactions).&#x20;

So while "proof-of-work" in this context isn't the same as when the dole office asks you for "proof of (not) working", you could think of it as a kind of metaphor.

We talked a bit about how the metaphor might work for the idea of "proof-of-stake". What do people do to prove they have a stake in society? We noticed that the wealthy are rarely asked to prove it, even though often, they couldn't care less about society and don't act like they have a stake in it; but the less-wealthy often have to prove they are decent, not scammy, not criminal, etc.

#### Proof of Listening?

And how about other proofs of belonging, or deserving something? Could you have proof of community; proof of humanity even? What about proof of lived experience? We agreed that you can still understand something very well (e.g. homelessness) even if you haven't experienced it yourself - but probably your insights and understanding will be from a different perspective than someone who has experienced it. And... maybe your insights should be influenced by the ideas of people who _have_ lived it? What if people who made policy about homelessness had to somehow give proof that they've listened to people who have experienced it? Proof of Listening?

### VALUING THE WORK WE DO

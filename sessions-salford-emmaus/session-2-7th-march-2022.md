# Session 2, 7th March 2022

## **PEOPLE**

9 people took part: Julie, Joe, Kev, Jack, Chris, Mark, Ian, Darren, and Vanessa.

### MONEY, TOKENS AND CONTROL

Is "value" the same thing as "worth"? We talked last week about how tough times or homelessness can make you value certain objects or things differently. This can lead to the weird sensation that Vanessa has christened **“worth-dissonance**” – **the feeling when you see that society values a thing very differently from how you value it.** So we listed some stuff that we think is way overpriced, or way underpriced, according to our individual sense of value.&#x20;

Then we talked about - if you were going to design a value-system, what would be worth a lot, and what would be worth nothing?

### HAVE YOU EVER USED A TOKEN?

Tokens are thing that are not money, but function a bit like money - they're a way to exchange value, so you use them like currency. At first, we thought we hadn't ever used one, but then we realised there are loads:

&#x20;\- supermarket loyalty cards\
&#x20;\- green shield stamps\
&#x20;\- sweeties, when you're a kid\
&#x20;\- cigarettes or tobacco\
&#x20;\- bartering and swapping generally\
&#x20;\- doing favours for people

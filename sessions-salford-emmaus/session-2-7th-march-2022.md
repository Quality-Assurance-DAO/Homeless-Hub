# Session 2, 7th March 2022

## **PEOPLE**

9 people took part: Julie, Joe, Kev, Jack, Chris, Mark, Ian, Darren, and Vanessa.

### MONEY, TOKENS AND CONTROL

Is "value" the same thing as "worth"? We talked last week about how tough times or homelessness can make you value certain objects or things differently. This can lead to the weird sensation that Vanessa has christened **“worth-dissonance**” – **the feeling when you see that society values a thing very differently from how you value it.** So we listed some stuff that we think is way overpriced, or way underpriced, according to our individual sense of value.&#x20;

#### Overpriced

Phone bills; Holidays and city breaks; diamonds; easter eggs; TVs; footie players esp. Man Utd; cut flowers especially on Valentines Day, they exploit the fact that everyone wants roses on that day

#### Underpriced

Love and affection; wages; time!

#### Then we talked about - if you were going to design a value-system, what would be worth a lot, and what would be worth nothing?

About buying flowers - they're dead in a day. Plastic ones should be better - things that last should be worth more than things that don't. But maybe real things should be worth more than fake ones? So should we value:\
&#x20;\- time (whether things last)?\
&#x20;\- authenticity, realness?\
&#x20;\- popularity?\
&#x20;\- equality - as in, everybody having a say in what things are worth?\
&#x20;\- everyone being able to have their own view of what things are worth, and that being reflected in the system?\
&#x20;\- judgement? expertise? experience? Different kinds of knowledge should be valued\
&#x20;\- Quality and functionality, not brand - it doesn't matter if something isn't a well-known brand, if it works\
&#x20;\- STOP CONFORMING!

### HAVE YOU EVER USED A TOKEN?

Tokens are thing that are not money, but function a bit like money - they're a way to exchange value, so you use them like currency. At first, we thought we hadn't ever used one, but then we realised there are loads:

&#x20;\- sure start/milk tokens\
&#x20;\- gift cards, book tokens\
&#x20;\- a present\
&#x20;\- doing a favour or a job for someone\
&#x20;\- a token of love (awww)\
\- arcade token, casino chips\
&#x20;\-  cigarettes or tobacco\
&#x20;\- time spent doing something for someone - time bank\
&#x20;\- supermarket loyalty cards\
&#x20;\- green shield stamps\
&#x20;\- bartering and swapping generally - sweeties when you're a kid

We noted that you can give _**or**_** ** receive a token, so you can sometimes decide what it is worth (receiver usually decides?) And we noted that its value might depend on levels of kindness in the society - if people are generally kind then some of these things are just normal, and don't have an extra value? And it depends on what power we have - if you are powerful, you are the one who decides what it's worth.\

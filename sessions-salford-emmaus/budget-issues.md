# Budget issues

### How to manage an ADA budget...

Obviously the price of ADA hasn't been doing well since we were first funded and paid in November - the price then was around £1.68, and it's now hovering around 70p.

As a new funded proposer, I was a bit green - I left the money in ADA. I wasn't exactly thinking it would go up again (although I thought it might); I just felt like it would be almost "disloyal" to Cardano to take the funding straight out to fiat. Also, I felt a bit unnerved by doing it, especially as I had no information on the tax implications.&#x20;

All of that is still an issue, but I just think I am less scared of it now - but it makes me think proposers do need more advice and support on how to manage funding.

### Recalibrating...

{% hint style="warning" %}
All that aside - the facts are that Homeless Hub funding is now worth less than the project budget.

And although I should probably have managed it differently - I didn't, and I can't go back and change that.

So this means the project will have to tighten its belt.

My priority is the commitment I made to participants of paying them £20 per session in recognition of their contributions and input. If my own fee has to drop in order to protect that, OK; or if I have to fit the documentation in where I can, rather than allocating paid time for it, then OK.

The proposal originally planned to work with 10 participants and 3 organisations. But given that Salford Emmaus is part of a much bigger organisation of Emmaus as a whole, so in a way, we're reaching wider than just one organisation; and also taking into account the wariness around crypto that I've faced from the Mustard Tree and from some other organisations I spoke to initially; it feels best to focus on the group of 10 to 12 participants that we have at Emmaus, and not try at this stage to pull in any other organisations.&#x20;

But I think the 10 sessions I originally planned for won't be enough to cover everything we want to cover, and produce a good final output. This group are quite deep thinkers, so we're not just whipping through things superficially; but I think I also underestimated how new blockchain technology is to people, and how we need time to unpick it a bit. So I want to increase the project to 15 sessions. We had some money in the budget for paying extra to participants to also function as translators; but as it turns out, everyone taking part at Emmaus has English as a first language, soit's not needed; it can be reallocated towards increasing the number of sessions.

I also think we can adjust how much we spend on the project's final output, and reallocate some of that budget to the participants' stipend. We have mentioned [arte povera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arte\_Povera) in sessions, and have talked about how the idea of making art with whatever materials you have to hand - for example, artists like [James Castle](https://jamescastle.com/) - is something that homeless and poor artists often do anyway. And a couple of the group have already pointed out that this fits Salford Emmaus - they run a second-hand furniture shop, so always have a lot of interesting scrap materials at their warehouse. It occurs to me that this whole approach of making with whatever you have to hand (which is how I worked when homeless, and how every homeless artists I've ever met has worked too) is pretty much in line with asset-based approaches...

So I will suggest to the group that we take that as a creative decision, and aim to use scrap materials in whatever we produce. We are not sure at this stage what the project's final output will be - but the budget situation would have made a big, physical public event impossible anyway, even without any changes. So we are looking now at ways to stimulate  public discussion in other ways than a big event.

I think these budget tweaks will enable us to have 15 sessions at Emmaus, and also produce an interesting final output.

### **VALUE**

**1) What we value**\
****What do homeless people value differently from most people? And ex-homeless people – are there value-structures that you never forget?

What kind of things are worth more when you are homeless than when you’re not; i.e. what has greater value in the economy of the homeless than in the normal economy?&#x20;

In other words, “worth-dissonance” – the feeling when you see the world valuing a thing very differently from how you value it

**Value more**

socks; tampax; a phone; privacy of your personal info (because often the price of being helped is that your privacy is not respected much); cats (because it is much harder to have a cat on the street than a dog); quiet; shelving; a smile instead of suspicion from a shopkeeper; tobacco (it's a currency); a bath instead of a shower; personal space; having an effect on the world; art materials; community (because you learn on the streets how important it is)

**Value less**

status/job stuff; recognition e.g. for your art work; privately owned stuff e.g. a garden? Telly. Things like gold or diamonds? No, cos the world values them, and that mattered.

**Value different:**

A drink; sex (it can be used as a kind of currency); food (you eat what you can, so preferences become less important); your clothes and makeup; certain places i just saw them differently. Having a choice e.g. over what I ate or wore.

**2) How is value determined in society??**

Subjective Theory of Value says _the value of a thing is not determined by any inherent property, nor by the amount of labour necessary to produce it, but instead is determined by the importance an acting individual places on it for the achievement of their desired ends_ . In other words, what matters is how much you personally need it.

IS THAT WHAT’S GOING ON HERE? or is it about what you can’t have? or things you’ve lived without?

_Value_ and _price_ are different – do we see **our** ideas of value represented in the world? More and more, I realise that different people have different ideas of what is valuable, but only some people’s ideas are represented in the world. We can see what those in power think is valuable everywhere we look

**3) Mapping**

The things we value more cos of homelessness – pick one of them, and look at how do you get that thing? Could you map places where you do and do not find it? as a way of making your value system visible?

**4) WHO (rather than what) is valued? How does society show you that you are/are not valued? When your community values you, how is that demonstrated?**&#x20;

**Ideas:** Society shows it values you through wages/money; being heard; being allowed to occupy space, physical or not; the way people look at you; your needs being generally known and understood by society; being credited for what you do.  \
**AGREE/DISAGREE SLIDERS on what shows us we are valuable:**

**3) What do you do in your community that is valuable, but not recognised?**&#x20;

Picking up litter; supporting a friend; I always take the bin out; I do not drive or fly, so i make less pollution; being vegan;) How does your community, or your society, record or recognise that contribution – or, does it?

How in general does your Emmaus community record and recognise people’s contribution?
